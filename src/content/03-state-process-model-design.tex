\section{State Process Model Design}\label{sec:state-process-model-design}
This section describes the state process model, with emphasis on its critical data structures, used in EDDIE's permission request process.
This model aims to encapsulate the permission process for accessing energy-related data across different countries in an abstract, yet comprehensive manner.

\subsection{Permission Request}\label{subsec:permission-request}
Although the detailed structure of permission requests varies across countries, they share several common attributes,
and certain key attributes are needed by EDDIE in every case.
Figure\ \ref{fig:permission-request} shows these attributes.
A fundamental permission request has two identifiers and a specific timeframe for the requested data.
For instance, if historical data from the past six months is sought, the start date would be six months prior to the current date,
and the end date would be the day before the present day.
The \texttt{permissionId} is utilized internally by both the permission request process model and EDDIE.
It assists in identifying the various states of the permission request originating from identical starting requests.
Lastly, the \texttt{connectionId} is an identifier assigned by the eligible party.
It connects entities within the eligible party's system to a permission request and acts like a foreign key.
As an example, the \texttt{connectionId} could represent a user's email address who uses the services provided by the eligible party.
This identifier is optional as not every use case necessitates the eligible party to identify the data provider.
For example, an eligible party who wishes to create general statistics of energy consumption does not need
to identify an individual user.

\subsection{State Process Model}\label{subsec:state-process-model}
The state process model serves as the uniting entity.
Every permission request sent to EDDIE corresponds to a state in this model.
Capable of accommodating various states, the model ably generalizes disparate permission processes implemented across countries.
The permission request initially assumes the ``created-state'' as depicted in Figure\ \ref{fig:process-model}.

The process model is crafted to cater to multiple use cases simultaneously.
Firstly, it is intended to generalize distinct permission processes implemented by various permission administrators.
This implies that some processes may skip states articulated in the present state process model as they may be catered to by other permission processes.
In this case, states are considered to implicitly be reached, as they are usually included in a later state of the permission process.
Therefore, the state process model presumes that the state was previously reached and updates the state of the permission request accordingly.

Secondly, the model caters directly to EDDIE.
The eligible party's ability to manage permission requests translates into their capability to manipulate these requests.
The process model implements this by introducing eligible party-specific states, such as the ``terminated state'' (described in subsection\ \ref{subsubsec:terminated-state}).

\subsubsection{Created State}
After it is created, EDDIE validates the permission request and checks for errors in the request.
One such error can be that the start date is after the end date.
If the request cannot be validated successfully, it will be moved to the malformed state.
The validation is done only on EDDIES side, as the user input data has to be checked and sanitized.
Such checks include validation of timeframes, the start date should be before the end date.

\subsubsection{Malformed State}
This state indicates that EDDIE cannot send the permission request to the permission administrator and is a final state.
After the malformed state, the permission request was fully processed and no permission was granted to the eligible party.

\subsubsection{Validated State}
If a permission request is successfully validated, it is moved to the validated state.
It can be further processed and then made ready to be sent to the permission administrator.
Sending it to the permission administrator will place the permission request in the pending permission administrator acknowledgment state.
If the permission administrator is not reachable for any reason, the permission request is placed in the unable to send state.

\subsubsection{Unable to Send State}
The unable to send state indicates that the services of the permission administrator where not reachable at the time this permission request needed to be sent.
It is possible to go back to the validated state to resend the permission request.

\subsubsection{Pending Permission Administrator Acknowledgment State}
When a permission request is sent to a permission administrator might send an acknowledgment that the request was successfully delivered to the permission administrator.
Before this acknowledgment is received, the permission request will be placed in the pending permission administrator response state until an acknowledgment is delivered.
Process models which do not implement an OAUTH flow cannot represent this state because there is no actual communication between EDDIE and the permission administrator happening.
The ENEDIS OAUTH flow would be one example of this~\cite{enedis-dev-guide}.

\subsubsection{Sent to Permission Administrator}
When the permission administrator gets the request, they will start processing it according to their process model.
They will check the request for validity according to their constraints.
Some permission administrators choose to send a message to EDDIE if the request was not valid, like EDA in Austria does.
In that case, the permission request will be placed in the invalid state.

At this point, manual intervention of the end user is needed.
They have to either accept or reject the permission request.
One will move the permission request in the accepted state and the other in the rejected state.

If the end user does neither accept nor decline the permission request, the permission request will run into a time-out.
This will place it in the time-out state.

\subsubsection{Invalid State}
A permission request might violate the constraints of a permission administrator.
In that case, the permission administrator can choose to inform the eligible party and therefore EDDIE via an automated message.
An invalid state is a final state, the permission request is fully processed, and no permission is granted.

\subsubsection{Rejected State}
An end user can choose to reject a permission request from an eligible party.
The rejected state is a final state and no permission is granted.

\subsubsection{Time Out State}
The permission request was neither accepted nor rejected, but a time-out was reached.
The time-out state is a final state, and the permission administrator does not grant permission to access data from an end user.

\subsubsection{Rejected State}
This state indicates that the end user rejected the permission request.
This is again a final state, and no permission is granted by the permission administrator.

\subsubsection{Accepted State}
The end user accepted the permission request and the permission administrator grants access to the end users requested data.
At this point, the permission request stays active until its time limit is reached.
The end user only grants access for a specific time period, after that the permission is automatically revoked by the permission administrator.
If the end user wishes to do so, they can also revoke the permission earlier for any reason.
The eligible party can also terminate an active permission for any reason.

\subsubsection{Time Limit State}
The permission ran its natural course and its time limit is reached.
This is a final state, and the eligible party can no longer access the end users data.

\subsubsection{Revoked State}
The end user revoked the permission early, removing access to their data to the eligible party.
This is a final state, and the eligible party can no longer access the end users data.

\subsubsection{Terminated State}\label{subsubsec:terminated-state}
The eligible party chose to terminate the permission before its time limit was reached and can no longer access the end users data.
This is a final state.
