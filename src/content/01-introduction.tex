\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
As part of the ``Clean Energy Package'', the European Union introduced legislation enabling eligible parties to access end users' energy data via a permission process.
Our paper aims to explore different permission process models, strategically selected from various countries, which are employed to gain access to the energy data of end users.
Energy data include production, consumption and master data, which will be explained in section\ \ref{sec:related-work}.
Specifically, energy data refers to the details of energy consumption, energy production, as well as the contractual nuances between end users and their Distribution System Operators(DSOs).
Utilizing comparison-based analysis of the explored process models, we aim to develop a generalized state process model.
The proposed state process model will include all the necessary states while bypassing those deemed unnecessary for the permission process~\cite{clean-energy}.
