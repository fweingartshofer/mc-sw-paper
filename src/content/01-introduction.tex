\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
The European Union introduced a set of laws in the clean energy package that allows eligible parties to access energy data from end users via a permission process.
The aim of this paper is to explore different permission process models to gain access to energy data of end users based in different countries.
Energy data includes energy consumption, energy production and data regarding the contract details between end users and their distribution system operators(DSOs).
The different permission process models are compared and based on the findings, a generalized state process model will be implemented.
The state process model covers all the necessary states and skips unnecessary ones for other permission processes~\cite{clean-energy}.
